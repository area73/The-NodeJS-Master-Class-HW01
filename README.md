Home Work 01 for The NodeJS Master Class

## Installation
These series of work are intended to be 0 module dependant , that means that no NPM or any other 
module manager are needed in order to run the program, just plain NodeJS :)

To run the server just open your terminal and from the root of this project run:

    node index.js 

Additionally you can pass NODE_ENV = <dev || staging || prod> to get different servers config    
     
      



## Homework Assignment #1 description

Please create a simple "Hello World" API. Meaning:

1. It should be a RESTful JSON API that listens on a port of your choice. 

2. When someone posts anything to the route /hello, you should return a welcome message, in JSON format. This message can be anything you want.
